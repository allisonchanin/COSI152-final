# COSI152-final
final project for cosi152

This is the final version of my COSI 152 Web Development app. 

It accesses all DMC thread colors, with the ability to add and delete those threads from a palette.

Eventually, I would like to add the ability to have multiple palettes, with unique names, so a user can have multiple palettes saved.

After that, I would like to add a pattern making mechanism. Where you can make a palette and then use that palette to make a cross-stitching pattern.
